Lecture 1

1-3. I know the installation worked because I was able to get a clean bill of "health" from doctor.py. Entering the rest of the commands on the software set-up page also produced the same results shown in the handbook, leading me to believe that my new environment has access to the tools that should have been installed.

4-5. I am able to run samtools. It is version 1.20. Entering "samtools" with no commands or parameters brings up a list of commands for samtools.

Lecture 2

1. I identified the command "diff" which can compare two files and show where the contents differ. We will probably have more tailored bioinformatics tools for the purpose, but I believe this command could be useful for looking at two very similar files, such as a gene sequence where one file contains a reference sequence and the other contains the genotyping results of a potential mutant. Using "diff" could quickly identify small variations in the text that would be easy to skim over by eye.

2. Using -i, it is possible to ignore case differences in the contents of two files being compared to diff. In the example I gave above, this could be helpful if the reference sequence and the genotyping results were given in uppercase and lowercase, and not matching cases. The flag -y could also be used to output the differences in a side-by-side comparison of two columns.

3. Using -h with -l will make the ls command adjust the units on the file sizes to keep the values to ~4 digits.

4. The flag -i will make rm ask for confirmation before attempting to remove each file, while -I will make rm ask for confirmation before removing more than three files at once.

5-7. One file I created is file1.txt.
