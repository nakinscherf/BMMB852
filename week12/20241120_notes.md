## 2024-11-20 BMMB852 Lecture: automation with parallel
### Kinscherf notes

- automation: from processing one sample to hundreds

- opened BioProject comma separated values file: interested in run_accession vs sample_alias
- making a mock Makefile
    - this doesn't actually do anything except print text and wait, just example for how to automate + substitute
```bash
SRR=SRR12345
NAME=sample
.ONESHELL:

all:
    @echo "# Running analysis for $(SRR) and $(NAME)"
    @SLEEP_TIME=$$(shuf -i 1-4 -n 1); sleep $$SLEEP_TIME;
    @echo "# Done $$SLEEP_TIME"
```
- how we've been substituting variables up to now:
```bash
make NAME=foo and SRR=123
```
- how to automate subbing in many different accessions and names?
    - writing a program to write another program
        - tool to "write/repeat" process and another to "queue" process
    - going from single process to multiple: pipeline
        - identifying pattern to run each step
            - *e.g.* SRR=SRR*
            - Istvan doesn't like this one
        - cycling between getting and processing samples

- why not pattern matching?
    - pattern matching not explicit
    - code depends on file it matches, order of matches not specified
    - subtle bugs, wrong results
    - "unreadable and ugly code"

- how to automate instead?
    - find roots of data; smallest piece of info to identify sample
    - construct commands from roots --> build out
    - use GNU parallel
        - tool to launch other programs in parallel

```bash
parallel echo Hello {} ::: A B C
        command  pattern input source
```
prints
- Hello A
- Hello B
- Hello C

```bash
parallel --dryrun -j 2 echo Hello {} more words ::: A B C
```
- dryrun will tell you what it's going to run/order
- -j # to run # things at once in parallel
    - max # things to run in parallel must â‰¤ # cores in CPU

```bash
parallel -j 2 -t 2 echo Hello {} more words ::: A B C ::: D F G
parallel -j 3 echo Hello {} more words ::: A B C ::: D F G
parallel -j 3 echo Hello {} and {} and {} ::: A B C ::: D F G
```

- the design
    - design starts as empty csv file
    - associates various attributes with the files
```bash
code design.csv
```
Run,Name

SRR123,SampleA

SRR124,SampleB

SRR125,SampleC

```bash
cat design.csv | parallel --colsep , --header : echo make all RUN={1} NAME={2}
# assign variable names by column #
cat design.csv | parallel --colsep , --header : echo make all RUN={Run} NAME={Name}
# assign variable names by column name
```
- going back to BioProject file
```bash
cat samples.csv | parallel --colsep , --header : echo make all RUN={run_accession} NAME={sample_alias}
cat samples.csv | head -5 | parallel --colsep , --header : echo make all RUN={run_accession} NAME={sample_alias}
```
- can now run Makefile on all 892 samples without changing variables out manually
    - figure out some way of glancing through results to make sure everything ran properly
- create an automation pipeline
- more tips for using parallel at: gnu.org/software/parallel/parallel_tutorial.html
    - person who made tool wants you to use ```bash parallel --citation ``` if you use it for a project but Istvan disapproves of this
- Istvan's tutorials for parallel: 
    - biostarhandbook.com/books/scripting/parallel-mastery/
    - biostarhandbook.com/books/scripting/parallel-loops/
- Istvan's tutorial for automating loops:
    - biostarhandbook.com/books/scripting/bash-loops/
    - don't use whatever explicit looping is
    - don't use "for"
